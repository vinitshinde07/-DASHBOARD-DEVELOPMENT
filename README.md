A dashboard is a visual interface that displays key data points, analytics, and insights in an organized manner. It helps users monitor trends, track performance, and make data-driven decisions efficiently.

Dashboards are widely used in business intelligence (BI), finance, healthcare, marketing, and predictive analysis to present complex data in an easily understandable format. They often include charts, graphs, tables, and real-time analytics to enhance decision-making.

With the right tools and technologies, dashboards can be interactive, dynamic, and user-friendly, offering real-time updates and insights.
